                    <p class="timeline-content">Since I was a kid, I LOVED to play. I played everything, from Mario to
                        multiplication games on a light-up toy to board games like Exploding Kittens with my family. My
                        parents wanted me to be curious growing up so
                        instead of playing with just stuffed animals, they let me play with electronic devices like the
                        toy
                        computer shown in the image, a light-up keyboard piano, and finally my very own laptop.

                    <p class="timeline-content"> I still reminisce on the days my dad would warn me about viruses
                        and teach me about the difference between memory and RAM. As a kid, everything went into one ear
                        and
                        out the other, but 20 years later, I finally learned the difference after taking my first
                        computer
                        architecture class, CS61C.

                    <p class="timeline-content">I love spending time outdoors, exploring, and just wandering, without
                        the
                        intent of finding something particular. The most beautiful things in life appear when you let
                        your
                        mind wander. Growing up, I didn't care about what other people were doing or thinking. I was in
                        my
                        own little world just taking it all in. My love for exploring led to curiosity, which bred
                        creativity and serendipity.</p>
                    <p class="timeline-content">When I'm not working, you can find me going for a walk, going down
                        random
                        streets, and talking to random people to stumble upon something new.</p>

                    <p class="timeline-content">One winter break in my sophomore year of high school, I was scrolling
                        through my old iPad. As I was going through, I found a bunch of really funny clips of myself
                        from
                        when I was little. I cherished the videos so much and wished that I recorded myself more as I
                        was
                        growing up. At that moment, I realized that every moment you don't record is a moment you'll
                        never
                        be able to look back on.</p>
                    <p class="timeline-content">From there, I picked up my laptop, opened iMovie, and began editing my
                        old
                        videos in the hopes of preserving my memories with my friends in family. On my YouTube, you'll
                        find
                        content ranging from cooking tutorials, piano videos, and event recaps. Take a look at my
                        channel
                        and give me a subscribe!</p>

                    <p class="timeline-content">I never planned to go to Berkeley. My dream school was UCLA, but I am
                        forever grateful that I became a bear. College is all about finding your fit, finding yourself,
                        and
                        pushing yourself to do uncomfortable things. It's about growth. Right in the center of Silicon
                        Valley, surrounded by other brilliant minds, accomplished professors, and curious voices, I've
                        had
                        the to meet extraordinary peers, join talented clubs, and even found my own startup.</p>
                    <p class="timeline-content">At Cal, I'm studying Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at the
                        College of Engineering and Business Administration at the Haas School of Business. I've had the
                        honor of being VP in the <a href="https://vsa.berkeley.edu/">Vietnamese Student Association</a>,
                        a founder in <a href="https://www.entrepreneursatberkeley.com/">Entrepreneurs @ Berkeley</a>,
                        and
                        External VP in <a href="https://codebase.berkeley.edu/">Codebase</a>. My favorite things to do
                        in
                        Berkeley are hosting a rootop BBQ social, meeting other founders at entrepreneurship mixers, and
                        catching up with some friends at Berkeley's AMAZING restaurants.</p>

                        opportunity to
                        intern at Aveva as a software development intern. At Aveva, I learned about industrial software,
                        networked with industry leaders in the domain, and created an internal web app for tracking
                        Azure

                        Irvine, to touching a codebase with over 30,000 lines of code, to finally making my own money,
                        this
                        was one of my most impactful summers, and one I'll never forget.</p>

                        off! My first baby in college was BudBase, a social media app designed to help you revive your
                        connections. The app is similar to Tinder, except it recommends people to you based on how long
                        ago
                        you've last seen them. Upon recommendation, the user can choose a date and time to meet up with
                        their connection and keep the friendship alive.
                    </p>
                    <p class="timeline-content">I had never thought of myself as a founder, let alone CEO, but BudBase
                        was
                        my first taste of venture capital and affirmation that I could be a successful founder.

                        industry. During the weekdays, you can find me studying for my classes, taking online courses on
                        LinkedIn Learning, going to the gym, or working on a new venture. In my free time, I LOVE
                        hosting
                        social events, whether it be Burgers and Burglars (escape room and burgers after), Board Games &
                        Boba, or Stories and Stirfry. I also love to play sports (badminton, volleyball, frisbee) and
                        edit
                        videos for my YouTube channel. Above all, I love meeting new people.</p>
